# Build

gradle build

If gradle is not installed, ./gradlew will work in its place.

# Run

Choose a port and run two instances of the chat client on the same machine.
The first instance must be the host and the second the guest:

./run/bin/chat-client --host <port>    # host
./run/bin/chat-client <port>           # guest
